- Search for and add coins from CoinGecko's top 100 list.
- Remove coins from the watchlist.
- Real-time price updates every 30 seconds.
- Responsive design for both mobile and desktop.

## Tech Stack

   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add the following line:
   ```

  - Parameters: `vs_currency=usd`, `order=market_cap_desc`, `per_page=100`
- `GET /api/v3/simple/price`: To fetch real-time price and 24-hour change data for the coins in the watchlist.
  - Parameters: `ids=<coin_ids>`, `vs_currencies=usd`, `include_24hr_change=true`

## Deployment

This project is configured for automatic deployment to Vercel. Any push to the `jules` branch will trigger a new deployment.

To deploy manually or to a different Vercel project:

1. **Install the Vercel CLI:**
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. **Deploy the project:**
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```
   Follow the prompts to link the project to your Vercel account. Vercel will automatically detect that this is a Vite project and configure the build settings accordingly.
